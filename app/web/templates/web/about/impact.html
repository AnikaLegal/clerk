            Our Theory of Change
        </h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
            At the heart of Anika’s approach to measuring impact is a Theory of Change, a framework that breaks down the inputs and activities required to produce the outputs and a chain of outcomes that lead to a longer-term change. By following this Theory of Change, we can see how our actions move the needle on access to justice.
